# Applied_Artificial_Inteligence
This project was developed for the subject **"Applied Artificial Intelligence"** in the Masterâ€™s in Automation and Robotics at the Polytechnic University of Madrid. In this final project, which accounted for most of the grade, various classifiers (k-NN, Bayesian, MLP, SOM, DLN) were implemented to classify the MNIST dataset.
